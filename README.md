# Profile Pages  
The goal of this facebook clone is to use React, Redux, and a Rails backend to create a site where users can connect with eachother. Each user has a profile page, where they can post on their own wall, friends can post on each others walls, you can view your friends list (or your friends friends), and you can update your cover photo and profile picture.

# Navbar  
The search bar helps users find new potential friends. They can log out from a dropdown in the navbar, and they can accept or deny friend requests. 
<br/>   
* The search bar checks all names for inclusion of the entered characters. Clicking a search result with the mouse will take you to that users page. Hitting the enter key at any given time (or pressing the search button) will take you to the top user fitting the search.

* The friend request dropdown will grow as you have more pending friend requests, and will update in real time as you accept/deny requests.

# Friend Requesting  
When you visit the profile of someone you aren't friends with, you won't have posting permissions. However users can view posts and send friend requests.

# User Authentication  
Users can create an account, log into an existing account, or log into my demo account for a quick and easy way to play around with the site!

# Newsfeed  
The newsfeed pulls posts in chronological order from all the friends of the current user, as well as posts on walls of current users. A user can also write a new post from the newsfeed which will live on their own wall as well.

# Posting, Commenting, Liking  
Any user who can view a post can comment on it, like the post, or like the comment. Users are limited to one like per item and can also unlike things. The button lives in a highlighted state when something has been liked by a user.
